A diverse mix of evidence types — from peer-reviewed experiments to practitioner reports — strengthens confidence in the overall findings.","report.scenarioDefIntro":"Each scenario filters the evidence base by publication year and data source type to model different assumptions about AI tool maturity. The Pessimistic scenario uses earlier research reflecting first-generation AI tooling; the Realistic scenario spans the full evidence base; the Optimistic scenario focuses on the most recent data capturing the agentic AI era.

"Cost Savings" translates those hours into monetary value using your configured salary rates — these represent efficiency gains (capacity freed for higher-value work), not headcount reductions. "Net ROI" equals cost savings minus the total AI transformation investment (tooling, consulting, training, internal effort). "ROI Ratio" is the multiple of each euro invested returned as savings — for example, 3.2x means €3.20 in efficiency gains per €1 invested.',"report.keyImplications":"Key Implications","report.implicationsText":"Under the realistic scenario, AI-powered development tools would free approximately {{hoursSaved}} of developer capacity annually — equivalent to roughly {{fteSaved}} full-time developer-equivalents (at {{hoursPerYear}} hours/year). This capacity can be redirected toward innovation, reducing technical debt, or accelerating delivery timelines without increasing headcount. Even the pessimistic scenario projects a positive return on investment, suggesting that the question is not whether to adopt AI tools, but how quickly to scale adoption across the organisation.","report.disclaimerTitle":"Methodology & Limitations","report.disclaimerText":'This analysis aggregates productivity-improvement percentages from published research and applies them to your organisation\'s parameters. Key limitations to consider: (1) Published studies may over-represent positive outcomes (publication bias). (2) Productivity gains vary significantly by team maturity, codebase complexity, existing tooling, and AI tool selection — actual results will differ from these projections. (3) "Cost savings" represent efficiency gains (time reallocation), not guaranteed budget reductions — realising the financial benefit requires deliberate redeployment of freed capacity. (4) The three-scenario model uses year-based data filtering as a proxy for AI maturity, which is a simplification. (5) Transformation costs are estimates — actual implementation costs depend on vendor selection, organisational readiness, and change management scope. This report is intended as a strategic decision-support tool, not a guarantee of outcomes. We recommend validating the projections with a time-limited pilot programme before committing to full-scale adoption.',"report.glossaryTitle":"Glossary","report.glossarySDLC":"SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) — The end-to-end process of planning, creating, testing, and deploying software.
