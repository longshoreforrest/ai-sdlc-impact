Three scenarios — Pessimistic, Realistic, and Optimistic — provide a range of outcomes to support decision-making under uncertainty. All figures are annual projections based on your configured team size, salary levels, budget allocation, and the proportion of work performed inhouse versus outsourced. Cost savings reflect efficiency gains only for inhouse staff, since outsourced work is unaffected by your organisation's AI tool investment.","report.dataFoundationIntro":"The projections in this report are grounded in a curated evidence base of publicly available research — including peer-reviewed academic studies, controlled experiments, industry surveys, and practitioner reports. This section summarises the scope, diversity, and credibility of the underlying data so that reviewers can assess the robustness of the analysis. A diverse mix of evidence types strengthens confidence in the overall findings, while the credibility rating system helps distinguish rigorous research from anecdotal reports.","report.scenarioDefIntro":"Each scenario filters the evidence base by publication year and data source type to model different assumptions about AI tool maturity. The Pessimistic scenario uses earlier research reflecting first-generation AI tooling (basic code completion); the Realistic scenario spans the full evidence base for a balanced view; the Optimistic scenario focuses on the most recent data capturing the agentic AI era (autonomous multi-step tools). For each filtered dataset, the mean productivity improvement per SDLC phase drives the financial calculations shown in the Executive Summary. This means the scenarios reflect genuinely different generations of AI capability, not just statistical variation.","report.roiConfigIntro":"This section provides a complete audit trail of every parameter used to generate the projections in this report. All inputs are configurable in the ROI Calculator and are reproduced here for full transparency and reproducibility.

Any deviation between these assumptions and reality will directly affect the projected outcomes.","report.sourceAppendixIntro":"Every data point cited in this report can be traced back to its original source. This appendix lists all data sources with their associated evidence points, impact percentages, and metadata — enabling independent verification by any reviewer. Sources are grouped by publication and include links to original materials where available.","report.metricsNote":'How to read these numbers: "Hours Saved" is the projected annual reduction in developer-hours, calculated from mean productivity improvements per SDLC phase, weighted by your budget allocation, and adjusted for the inhouse ratio (since only inhouse staff benefit from AI tools). "Cost Savings" translates those hours into monetary value using your configured salary rates — these represent efficiency gains (capacity freed for higher-value work), not headcount reductions. "Net ROI" equals cost savings minus the total AI transformation investment (tooling licences, consulting, training, and internal implementation effort). "ROI Ratio" is the multiple of each euro invested returned as savings — for example, 3.2x means €3.20 in efficiency gains per €1 invested. "Payback Period" estimates how many months of accumulated savings are needed to recover the total first-year investment.',"report.keyImplications":"Key Implications for Decision-Makers","report.implicationsText":"Under the realistic scenario, AI-powered development tools would free approximately {{hoursSaved}} of developer capacity annually — equivalent to roughly {{fteSaved}} full-time developer-equivalents (at {{hoursPerYear}} productive hours/year). This freed capacity can be strategically redirected toward: (a) accelerating product delivery and time-to-market, (b) reducing accumulated technical debt, (c) enabling innovation and R&D initiatives, or (d) absorbing growth without proportional headcount increases. Even the pessimistic scenario projects a positive return on investment, suggesting that the question is not whether to adopt AI tools, but how quickly to scale adoption across the organisation. We recommend starting with a pilot programme in the highest-impact phases to validate these projections before full-scale rollout.","report.disclaimerTitle":"Methodology & Limitations","report.disclaimerText":'This analysis aggregates productivity-improvement percentages from published research and applies them to your organisation\'s specific parameters (team size, salaries, budget allocation, and inhouse ratios). It is designed as a strategic decision-support tool, not a guarantee of outcomes.\n\nKey limitations to consider:\n\n(1) Publication bias: Published studies may over-represent positive outcomes. Negative or null results are less likely to be published.\n\n(2) Context sensitivity: Productivity gains vary significantly by team maturity, codebase complexity, existing tooling, programming languages, and AI tool selection. Actual results will differ from these projections.\n\n(3) Cost savings ≠ budget cuts: The "cost savings" in this report represent efficiency gains — time freed for higher-value work. Realising the financial benefit requires deliberate redeployment of freed capacity (e.g., into feature development, debt reduction, or innovation). Without intentional reallocation, the time savings may dissipate into unstructured work.\n\n(4) Scenario simplification: The three-scenario model uses publication-year filtering as a proxy for AI tool maturity. Real-world AI capability improvement is more nuanced than this time-based approach suggests.\n\n(5) Transformation costs are estimates: Actual implementation costs depend on vendor selection, organisational readiness, change management scope, and the pace of adoption.\n\n(6) Inhouse ratio assumption: Savings are calculated only for the inhouse portion of each SDLC phase. If your outsourcing model changes, these projections should be recalculated.\n\nRecommendation: Validate the projections with a time-limited pilot programme (e.g., 2–3 months with one team) before committing to full-scale adoption.
